# Cypress-automation

The goal of this exercise is to assess your proficiency in writing robust and maintainable end-to-end tests for web APIs. You will be required to implement test cases that cover common API operations such as fetching data, adding new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory (cd Cypress-tests). (You will need to have Node.js installed on your machine)
3. Now you can run the tests by running `npm run cypress:api` in the project directory for headless test run.
4. To run the tests in the Cypress Test Runner, run `npm run cypress:open-api` in the project directory.
